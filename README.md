# As asked in the Question :
## Sample Data set:
{15, 20}, {10, 30}, {17, 19},{5, 20}, {12, 15}, {30, 40}
Check for {14,16}, {21,23}.
First the interval tree is formed using the given sample data and printed.
Then {14,16}, {21,23} are inserted and the final tree is printed to test the insertion
Then we search for {14,16} , {21,23} and also {41,45} (which is not present) to test the search function.
Then {14,16}, {21,23} are deleted and the final tree is printed to test the deletion
